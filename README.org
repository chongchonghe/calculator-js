* A physics calculator written in JavaScript

** About

This is an atempt to write a browser-based calculator with similar features to a [[https://github.com/chongchonghe/acap][Python calculator for physicists]] that I wrote. 

** How to use?

Clone this repository and open index.html in your browser, or try it out [[https://www.astro.umd.edu/~chongchong/calculator/][here]].

** Notes

- math-v2.js: based on math.js, changes: added toCGS()
- CGS: https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/

** To-do

- [ ] toSI on scalar, or hasunit(). Check github issue response
- [ ] test out toCGS
- [ ] Define variable aliases: Msun, m_p, ... Write tables of constants.
- [ ] bug: 'year' returns 's'
- [ ] Add more units: pc, Mpc, yr, Myr, etc.
- [ ] Long line wrap causes dis-alignment.
- [ ] cgs for EM?
